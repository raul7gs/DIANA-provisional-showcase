# DIANA inner structure

DIANA divides the data analysis and visualization process in four* (data analysis also included in the full version) well differentiated parts, each related to a different step inside the data visualization process. These are: data processing, charts generation,
dashboards and report generation.

# Data processing

As mentioned in the general read me file, DIANA accepts multiple input formats. Preferibly CPACS (XML aircraft design schema) to perform the different aircraft design charts, as a predefined structure is needede for that level of detail. Nevertheless, csv data can
also be used as an input for the remaining functinalities within the app. Of course a previous DIANA project can al so be used as an input.

The application is able to with missing parts
