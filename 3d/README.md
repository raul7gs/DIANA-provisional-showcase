DIANA is able to deal with three D geometries in CPACS thanks to TIGL software. DIANA calls TIGL and obtains a STL file of the geometry. After that, the geometry is loaded in the Frotnend using the Three.js library. In the Frotnend, the user can change the view of 
the object and can decide wherther to show or not the measures automtically. There is also full control on the measures ot be shown though the settings button, as well as on the level of opacity through a slider.
