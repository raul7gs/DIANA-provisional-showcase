DIANA (Data Interactive Analysis and Navigation Application) is a web-based platform that enables users to transform their complex data into meaningful, interactive visualizations. Through an intuitive graphical interface, users can explore datasets, generate customized visuals, and organize them into dynamic dashboards for a comprehensive overview of their data landscape. DIANA empowers analysts and decision-makers to uncover actionable insights faster.

DIANA accepts both CSV and XML data files as input. XML files must conform to the CPACS data standard to ensure proper parsing and visualization. This structure enables DIANA to automatically generate a range of plots through predefined templates, organized into “design kits” that correspond to specific parts of the CPACS data model, allowing users to quickly explore targeted aspects of their data.

For CSV data, users can still take full advantage of DIANA’s general plot creation functionality. This enables manual selection of variables and visualization types, providing flexibility for datasets that do not follow the CPACS schema. For more details, please refer to the following paper:
